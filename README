*** Latest Updates (1/7/12)***
A bunch of small changes that should make the game more enjoyable to play.
- Platform hit detection now based on the whole player, not just the center
	- This means that you can be on a platform all the way out to the last pixel
- Death screen allows player to respawn with 1 health on the previous screen
- Health bars shrunk
- Health bars now show in two rows of 5
- Every set of 10 health is color coded
- Health is now shown in small text next to the health bars
- Boss health bar changed to match the new style
- Black border added to the game to see screen edges and look nice
- Text at the top moved around slightly to accomodate changes
- Death counter added
- Statistics page reworked slightly
