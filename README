*** Quick Summary ***
A 2D platformer in HTML5/Javascript that I am currently working on.
Use WASD to move and Space to shoot. Press Enter to see statistics and skills.
Number keys such as 1, 2, 3... (above WASD) are used for skills.
Press P at any time to save the game. (requires cookies, clearing cookies will delete saves)
jquery, json, and jstorage are used as a basis for the save system. 
These are contained within the libraries folder. If you exclude it, you will not be able to save.

*** How to Run it ***
To play the game simply click the "Download as zip" button at the top of this page.
Unzip the files and open the .html file in your favorite internet browser.
(Does not work with old browsers, HTML5 support is required)
