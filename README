*** Quick Summary ***
A 2D platformer in HTML5/Javascript that I am currently working on.
Use WASD to move and Space to shoot. Press Enter to see statistics and skills.
Number keys such as 1, 2, 3... (above WASD) are used for skills.

*** How to Run it ***
To play the game simply click the "Download as zip" button at the top of this page.
Unzip the files and open the .html file in your favorite internet browser.
(Does not work with old browsers, HTML5 support is required)
